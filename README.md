## 📌 Project Overview  
The Digital Detectives of Environment (DiDE) project focuses on identifying and understanding environmental pollution patterns on the Hacettepe University Beytepe Campus through **crowdsourced geographic information (CGI)**.  
Students collect spatial data (trash bins, recycle bins, full bins, cigarette butts) and analyze spatio-temporal patterns to identify pollution hotspots and potential “environment detectives.”

## Why addressing cigarette butt pollution is important for our campus?

Cigarette butt pollution is recognized as one of the most persistent and underestimated forms of environmental contamination. The paper I reviewed emphasizes that cigarette filters are made of cellulose acetate, a plastic material that does not biodegrade easily and can remain in the environment for many years. Research shows that these filters release toxic substances such as nicotine, arsenic, lead, and other heavy metals into soil and water systems, creating long-lasting ecological risks (Novotny et al., 2009). On university campuses—where student density is high and smoking behavior is common—cigarette butts accumulate rapidly, forming microplastic hotspots that threaten both aesthetic quality and environmental health.

Scientific studies further highlight that cigarette butts act as localized sources of pollution capable of harming soil organisms, reducing soil fertility, and contaminating stormwater through leachate transport. Moerman and Potts (2011) demonstrated that rainwater facilitates the release of these chemicals, meaning that even a small number of discarded cigarette butts can pollute surrounding green areas over time. Since Beytepe Campus includes large natural spaces, picnic zones, and wooded areas, the environmental impact of cigarette butt accumulation becomes especially relevant. Pollution in these zones disrupts natural habitats and may indirectly affect campus wildlife.

In addition to ecological impacts, cigarette butt litter contributes to negative visual perception and increases the workload of campus maintenance teams. Studies show that visible litter triggers further littering behavior, reinforcing an overall decline in environmental responsibility among individuals. Addressing cigarette butt pollution at Hacettepe University is, therefore, necessary not only to preserve campus cleanliness but also to support a culture of environmental awareness. Torkashvand et al. (2020) underline that cigarette butt accumulation reflects behavioral patterns within communities, and recognizing these patterns enables targeted interventions. For this reason, monitoring cigarette butt hotspots through the DiDE project is an essential step for understanding the spatial distribution of harmful waste and developing effective solutions. Overall, the scientific literature clearly shows that cigarette butt pollution poses chemical, ecological, and social challenges for university environments, making its identification and mitigation a critical need for our campus.
